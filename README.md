# Factory

A simple factory game.

Usage:
```bash
npm install
node server.js
```
And open `http://localhost:1337/WebInterface/` in a browser. The main game is abstracted from the web interface, but the web interface is gross (code and looks).

All images and code shown (except for Express, npm, node...) were made by me (at least in the first commit)
